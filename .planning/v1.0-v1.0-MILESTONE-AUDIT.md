### Requirements Needing Human Verification

| REQ-ID     | Phase | Status      | Reason                                              |
| ---------- | ----- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| INSTALL-03 | 1     | NEEDS_HUMAN | Git tags for rollback - deployment process decision |

### Integration Gap (Non-Blocking)

| Gap ID                    | Severity | Description                                                                                        |
| ------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CLI-MISSING-NOTIFICATIONS | Medium   | CLI doesn't load notifications plugin - notifications won't trigger in `butler process-voice` flow |

## Tech Debt

### Phase 1

- CLI config command deferred to Phase 12
- INSTALL-03 (Git tags) - human action required
- Human verification needed: install flow, butler doctor, E2E voice pipeline

### Phase 2

- Human verification needed: notification display, error notification, waiting sound, plugin disable test

## Orphan Detection

No orphaned requirements detected. All requirements in REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table are covered by at least one phase's VERIFICATION.md.
